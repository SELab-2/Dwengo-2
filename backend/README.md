## Dwengo-2 Backend

This project serves as a module in the Dwengo-2 interactive learning application.
It is a Node.js/Express backend project exposing a REST API to the [Dwengo-2 frontend](../frontend/README.md) application.
We use TypeScript and Jest to make our implementation type-safe and make sure it works as expected.
