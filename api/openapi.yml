# TODO - Email update
# TODO - Check if we can reuse request bodies
# TODO - Create a schema for the operations field in bodies
# TODO - Url query parameters like ?page=<nr>
# TODO - Defining the resources structures
# TODO - Should we add courses as resource is this an optional feature
# TODO - We have assignments but what about interactive learning objects that act as tasks
# TODO - Think of how to handle the questions/chat, operations or not
# TODO - Code for joining a class, maybe /<method> endpoint (e.g. join)
# TODO - How to handle token expiration, how to detect it and how to refresh it, sign out and in or ...
# TODO - Examples I guess
# TODO - Groups this is an example we need a generic operations schema if we wish to simplify as it differs from the classes operations if we want the group assignment to not go through a code but instead through teacher assignment
# TODO - Were multiple teachers an option?
# TODO - For those generic schemas using anyOf when referencing can we define "which of" for the local $ref
